        <p>I am an Economics undergraduate at The Ohio State University with broad interests in applied economics. I am particularly focused on development economics, social and welfare economics, and the economics of education and human capital. My current work explores structural forms of poverty and consumption behavior, including an ongoing project developing the Consumption Structure Index (CSI) as a framework to analyze functional and symbolic exclusion beyond income.</p>

    <!-- About -->
   <section id="about" class="section card">
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I am an undergraduate student majoring in Economics at The Ohio State University. For me, studying economics is not only about grades or career prospects. It is an entry point to understanding how the world operates. What first drew me to this field was the way economics speaks to the real questions that have long puzzled me. Why did the Reform and Opening Up generate such tremendous economic growth and social transformation in China. Why do some people remain unable to change their fate even when society as a whole is prospering. Why is education a channel of mobility for some families but becomes a wall for others. Why do developing countries seem to be growing but so many young people still feel that the future is hopeless.</p>

  <p>These questions gradually directed my interest toward applied economics. I want economics to be more than theoretical deduction. It should also be a tool that responds to real social problems. I am particularly interested in development economics, social and welfare economics, education, and human capital. These fields all point to one fundamental question. How do economic structures shape people’s opportunities, choices, and futures.</p>

  <p>I am not satisfied with only discussing income inequality or GDP growth rates. I am more concerned with what I call a form of structural visibility. That is, whether individuals are recognized by social institutions and whether they have the qualification to be seen and heard. This has led me to reflect on consumption, identity, and social capital as factors beyond traditional models and to begin constructing my own analytical framework to understand that poverty is not only a lack of resources but a restriction on participation.</p>

  <p>In economics, I begin from institutions and development. Acemoglu’s research on the nature of institutions and North’s historical understanding of institutional evolution laid the foundation for my understanding of differences in growth and distribution. Olson’s analysis of interest groups, institutional rigidity, and the idea of a market-augmenting government helped me recognize the internal links among incentive structures, power distribution, and national prosperity. Kremer’s O-Ring model revealed how complementarity and coordination failures can become bottlenecks to development. Sen’s capability approach and Schultz’s human capital theory showed me that education and health are not only sources of income but also determine people’s basic functions and capabilities. Spence’s signaling theory further expanded my understanding of education as both an investment in productivity and a mechanism of selection in the labor market.</p>

  <p>When economic models are insufficient to fully address social complexity, I draw on social theory as a supplement. Foucault’s study of knowledge and discipline, Weber’s analysis of bureaucracy and legitimacy, Goffman’s work on stigma and interaction, and Giddens’s interpretation of structure and agency all provide diverse ways to observe the relationship between individuals and institutions. Durkheim and Bourdieu reveal the complex role of education in shaping social order through integration and cultural reproduction. The ideas of Coleman and Nan Lin on social capital help me understand the relationship between informal networks and access to resources. These perspectives remain supplementary. Their purpose is to fill blind spots in economic analysis and provide clues for empirical research that can be tested and replicated.</p>

  <p>At the philosophical level, I am deeply influenced by existentialist thought. Sartre’s emphasis on freedom and responsibility, Camus’s pursuit of meaning in the absurd, Heidegger’s reflection on being-in-the-world, and Kierkegaard’s focus on individual existence made me realize that human beings are not abstract rational agents. They are individuals who constantly choose, act, and seek authenticity in concrete situations. This philosophical foundation pushes me to keep my research grounded in a concern for human beings. It helps me stay alert to theoretical simplifications of real life and encourages me to face uncertainty and problems with honesty and courage.</p>

  <p>I do not know what kind of researcher I will eventually become. But I am certain of one thing. I do not want to repeat existing answers. I want to ask questions that go to the essence of problems and hold potential for originality. The research I pursue should carry the weight of reality. It may not be perfect but it must be truthful, sincere, and willing to take risks. I will continue to work on both mathematical modeling and empirical identification. I want to use clear models to explain mechanisms and rigorous evidence to test conclusions. I hope to become a scholar whose work can be verified and who is willing to be corrected.</p>
